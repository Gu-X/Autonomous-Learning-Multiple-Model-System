# Autonomous-Learning-Multiple-Model-System
The code for Autonomous Learning Multi-Model System with Gaussian type membership function. 

This work is an alternative version of Autonomous Learning Multi-Model System using Gaussian type membership function as described in [a]. 
The original version of Autonomous Learning Multi-Model System as described in [b] uses Cauchy type membership function.
